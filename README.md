# PDLLðŸ˜Š
PDLL's mission is to build a backend agnostic python deep learning framework for education, pluging and playing for different numpy-like computing engines.
Which including autograd, nn modules, optimizer, io, .etc.

## Getting Started

```python
In [1]: import pdll as L

In [2]: a = L.rand(2, 2, 3, requires_grad=True)
In [3]: b = L.rand(3, 3)
In [4]: c = a @ b + L.rand(2, 3)
In [5]: d = (c ** 2) * 2 - L.ones_like(c)
In [6]: d.mean().backward()

In [7]: a.grad
Out[7]: 
Tensor([[[0.71458999 0.87984239 0.73015823]
  [0.76491385 1.04176047 0.89780678]]
  
 [[1.07044392 1.33654949 1.12387667]
  [0.74022419 1.01408228 0.86196845]]])

```
